# React-Webpack-TypeScript-pnpm-Boilerplate
A React boilerplate with:

- Webpack as bundler
- Babel as transpiler
- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) as routing library
- Jest as testing framework
- [typestyle](https://github.com/typestyle/typestyle) as css-in-js library

## Things to note
### `path-to-regexp` is locked to an older version
Because react-router won't work with newer version, related issue: [#6203 Typescript import path-to-regexp error](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/6203).
