# Vue-Webpack-ECMAScript-Boilerplate
A Vue boilerplate with:

- Webpack as bundler
- Babel as transpiler
- Jest as testing framework
- [typestyle](https://github.com/typestyle/typestyle) as css-in-js library

## FAQ
### Why NOT vue-cli?
Vue-CLI is cool but still lack some customization (Babel/Webpack/devserver) needed in this boilerplate.

### Why `typestyle` but not any other css-in-js library?
Pros:
- Does NOT introduce extra Babel plugins
- Simple
- Flexible
- I prefer writing everything in JS: JSX, css-in-js, Babel/Jest/ESLint configurations
